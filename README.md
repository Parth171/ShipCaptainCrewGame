# CSE3120-Project

Ship, Captain, Crew Program

## Description 

This project features the popular dice game Ship, Captain, Crew! This version of the game features different game modes which the user can play to gain a fulfilled playing experience. 

## Dependancies
This project ultilizes the *random* library, which is in-built into Python. For this program, the user is not required to install any external libraries/dependancies.

## Instructions

This program contains three files. The user is only required to interact with the game.py file. Depending on the input option the user chooses from the menu, the user will be prompted to input the name of the players playing in that current round. Throughtout the program the user will be required to press ENTER to proceed with the program. This is done to embellish the user experience and ensure user engagement. 


# Revisions to the Program

After receiving your feedback, I made some change to the program for it to run better. Firstly, I ensured that when the user gets Ship, Captain, and Crew by the third roll, they get their gold by adding up the remaining two dies. Furthermore, I tested the program multiple times and ensured that the gold was properly being saved and tallied in the 'best-of' rounds. Each step is clearly displayed for the user (It is recommended to maximize the terminal that runs the program as the user may miss to read some text with a smaller view causing confusion to the user). After rigorous testing, the program seems to function as expected with no bugs. I chose to remove the "One Player Mode" extra feature as it seemed redundant and overcomplicated the program.


## Extra Feature

### Best-of Rounds. 
I added a game mode where two users can play a "Best-of" game. In this game mode, two users go against one another for the amount of times they chose to (for example: Best of Three)  and the program display the winner according to who gets the highest gold throughout all rounds played. In this feature, the game kept track of each player's gold using an array and summed the gold from each round to determine the winner. This feature not only allows the user to play continuously with their friend, but also keeps track of their total gold. 



## My Experience with this Project

Personally, I found this project to be on the difficult end of the spectrum when comparing it to the other multiday projects we have done in the past. Through the in class lessons and the notes we made, I understood the concept of OOP but the implementation of what we learned was initially difficult me. Through this project, and the through the trail and error, I was able to better understand how to incorporate OOP into my program. I found great value in this project because I was able to learn through my own mistakes and research, which allowed me to better grasp OOP concepts and learn not just what they are, but how they can be used to enhance the program.
